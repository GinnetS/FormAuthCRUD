# FormAuthCRUD
This project is an application that manages forms with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support. Additionally, it includes a user authentication system and role management, allowing access control based on specific permissions. Ideal for systems where forms require validations and controlled access depending on the type of user.
